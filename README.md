Any updates to this repository will be sent to the "EpicBot Support Server" for logging. This repository will be updated whenever there is a change to the bot or its code. Any information on the bot can be found here on this repository so be sure to check back here for any details or support as well as our bot discord server which will be linked down bellow this line. 

# When will this bot get updated?
This bot will be updated hopefully daily and if not daily then at leased 2-3 times per week. This is only to give the owner (Henry) some time to gather ideas and figure out how to put them into action. If this schedule for some reason changes, don't be worried. It is problebly because Henry is working on school work or studying for a test. This can be very hard to keep track of a Discord server, a GitHub repository, and school work at the same time so please respect Henry for what he can get done in a weekly basis. 
***
When this bot gets updated (including repository) there will always be at leased 1-2 new bot commands implomented into the bot. This means that every single update on the repository = 1-2 new bot commands for the bot. This is really good to keep the EpicBot community alive and popular as well as the bot getting the atention that it deserves. This is personally a pretty good plan to keep this bot alive and I hope that the EpicBot community thinks the same way as well.
