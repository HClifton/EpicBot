## Reporting an Issue

This section will help you report an issue if you come accross one.

If you come accross an issue with our bot it is best to report it
as an issue immedietly so that we can get on it's case and fix the
problem that you are having. This is very important to us as we
want our community to be as safe and bug free as it can possibly
get! So therefor if you come accross a bug be sure to check out
this section so that you can get instructions on what to do with
the bug and or issue.

If you come accross a bug or issue you will need to report it
immedietly so that the team can get on it. This is really important
as our goal is to keep this community and bot completely bug free.
But we are going to need some info when you go to report the bug
that you came accross. Some of this info is: Bot Version, Command
(If Possible), Where, When, What, and finally a 1 paragraph long
description describing what the bug does or what causes the bug.
This is all needed in order to make it easier to patch the error as
well as figure out what exactly happened to cause the error. 

For more info please be sure to ask in our *EpicBot Support Server*
in Discord!
